# 2026-02-13

- Fletcher asked "update memory." (No prior memory files existed.)
- Context from 2026-02-12 group chat: Fletcher asked what I can help with and what model I’m running (openrouter/openai/gpt-5.2-codex).
- System logs surfaced errors: python http.server bind failure (address in use) and Flask module missing for kanban-server.py; later pip showed requests deps satisfied in venv.
- I asked for clarification on the update target and whether to fix port + install Flask.
