# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## Tech Stack

### Current Projects
- Dashboard development (primary focus)

### Development Environment
- Language preferences: (to be determined based on project needs)
- Testing approach: (to be determined)
- Deployment: (to be determined)

### APIs & Integrations
_(Document APIs, credentials locations, rate limits as you work with them)_

### Code Locations
_(Track where different codebases live)_

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
